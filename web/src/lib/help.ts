    title: "VPN",

  setup: {
    title: "Setup",
    body: "The first-run setup: which sensors to run, which router ports to open, the VPN, your own address, abuse reports and alerts. Every step can be skipped and reopened from Settings. Where a change needs the host, the page shows the command to copy; it never edits your files.",

    title: "Sensors and ports",
    body: "Each sensor, the port to open on your router, the port on this machine it is forwarded to, and whether it has received a connection in the last 24 hours. The status is read from the stored events. To switch sensors on or off, copy the command from the setup.",

  network: {
    title: "Network",
    body: "The Selfhostr network pools what many installations see, so an attacker seen by five or more sensors gets one strong report instead of many weak ones.
