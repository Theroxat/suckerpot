"""The setup checklist (M24, ``docs/design/m24.md`` section 3). Admin only, read only.

Every item is computed from real state with the API role: the last event of each sensor, the
gate rows ingest and the collector publish, the reporting settings, the self addresses, the alert
channels and the provider keys. ``detail`` is a short English sentence (never a value: no key,
address or mailbox is ever repeated), ``href`` a dashboard path. The host firewall cannot be seen
from inside the stack, so it is not an item.
