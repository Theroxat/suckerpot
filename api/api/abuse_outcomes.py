"""What came of the reports (M26): the outcome of one report, the owner's override, the summary.

Ingest derives ``auto_outcome`` from verified replies; the owner may set ``manual_outcome`` by
hand (this role cannot write the automatic columns, ingest cannot write the manual ones). The
effective outcome is ``COALESCE(manual_outcome, auto_outcome)``. "No answer" is not stored: it is
an outcome of ``none`` on a report sent more than ``ABUSE_NO_ANSWER_DAYS`` ago.

GET routes are open to both roles; writes are administrator only by the default-deny rule.
Demo reports are never counted.
