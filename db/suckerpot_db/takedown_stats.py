"""Takedown statistics (M27, docs/design/m27.md section 6): pure functions, no database.

Used by the API (live numbers) and by the ingest roll-up, so both count the same way.

Right-censoring: a target counts toward "taken down within H" only if it was observed for H (or
went down within H). A target reported 10 hours ago says nothing about the 48-hour rate, so it is
left out of the denominator. A target whose tracking stopped early is observed only until then.
