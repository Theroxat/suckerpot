"""Retention (design M29 invariant H3). The hub keeps as little as the protocol allows.

* per-node observations: ``HUB_OBS_RETENTION_DAYS`` (14), day granularity;
* batch markers: 14 days; nonces and challenges: until they expire (10 minutes);
* contributor links: when the target is resolved or after 30 days;
* takedown votes: 30 days; weekly statistics: 8 weeks;
* abuse.ch submissions: finished ones 365 days, like reports;
* feeds: removed entries 90 days, runs 30 days, delisting evidence 30 days after the decision,
  decided delisting requests 180 days (open ones wait for their decision, without contact and
  evidence after 180 days), expired allow-list
  rows and payload links straight away;
* verification tasks (clear link included) and their attestations: 14 days after the task ended;
  the daily counters stay;
* observatory aggregates (network-wide, no node reference): 400 days;
* nodes with no request for 30 days are deleted with everything linked to them.
