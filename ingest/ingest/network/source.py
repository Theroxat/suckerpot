"""What the batch builder may read, and nothing else (design M29 section 9.4, N3).

Every query here lists its columns. It reads ``sessions`` counters, ``indicators`` (type, value,
role, host, trusted), ``fetch_targets`` / ``samples`` metadata and the high-confidence C2 links of
analysed samples. It never touches the event table, its JSON payloads, a credential, a command or
an HTTP field: ``tests/network/test_static.py`` fails when this file or ``builder.py`` mentions
them.
