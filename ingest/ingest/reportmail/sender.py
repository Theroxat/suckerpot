"""Sending abuse reports by SMTP, the ingest side of M25 (design doc M25, section 2.3).

The API writes ``abuse_send_requests`` rows; this module answers them. In auto mode it also
schedules the ready reports after the hold. Nothing is sent unless the owner configured the
profile and chose a mode; demo reports and reports that fail the identity guard are never sent.

Order of a send, each step stopping the whole thing:

1. the request is still pending (row locked, so a cancel waits and a late cancel is refused);
2. the profile is complete, the mode allows it, the daily cap (auto) is not reached;
3. the egress gate is open. If not, the request STAYS pending (a test fails with
   ``egress_closed`` after two minutes): nothing is attempted, no socket is created;
4. the report is re-rendered from the stored evidence and the complete serialized message is
   guarded (``guard_failed:<codes>``, including ``no_self_address``);
5. delivery through the VPN proxy (``outgoing.deliver``), gate checked again right before connect;
6. the report becomes ``sent`` (``sent_via = 'smtp'``) and the request ``sent``, in one commit.
