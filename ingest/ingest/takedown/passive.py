"""Passive signals and the state update (design M27 sections 4.5 and 5). Database only.

* ``sightings``: did our own sensors see a reported attacking address again?
* ``samples``: did a sample first seen after the report point to a reported C2?
* ``update_states``: run ``state.decide`` for the targets whose checks changed.

A check row is written when the answer changes (and a ``seen`` answer is refreshed once a day),
so the table does not grow by one row per worker cycle.
