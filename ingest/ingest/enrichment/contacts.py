"""Probable command-and-control addresses of known malware, read from threat-intel providers.

For a file hash that VirusTotal or abuse.ch already recognise, the providers know which network
addresses public sandboxes saw that malware contact. This module holds the pure parts (parsing,
validation, confidence, caps) and the SQL; the requests themselves are made by ``IntelWorker``
under the same rules as every other lookup: fixed hosts, a body cap, persisted daily quotas.

What is read is a string. Nothing here, or anywhere after it, fetches, resolves or connects to an
address: they are shown to the owner as defanged text and offered to the blocklist scoring.

Confidence:

* ``high``: ThreatFox lists the address as ``botnet_cc`` for that hash.
* ``medium``: VirusTotal's sandboxes saw the malware contact it, and it is a public address that
  is not on the never-block list (resolvers, big SaaS and CDN names) nor in the owner's ignore
  list.
* anything else is dropped, never stored.
