"""The process-wide egress gate and the only HTTP client factory ingest may use.

Every outbound call goes through ``suckerpot_egress``: the VPN proxy, with the gate checked before
each request. The gate starts closed and only ``main`` runs its self-check loop, so a client built
anywhere else (a unit test, a forgotten code path) can never reach the network: it raises
``EgressClosed``. ``tests/test_egress_static.py`` keeps raw clients out of this package.
