# Development

This page is for people who change the code. It explains the repository layout, the tools and how to run them. The tools run inside containers, so the host needs only Docker and `just`.

## Ground rules

- **English everywhere.** Code, comments, commit messages, docs and UI strings.
- **The repository is public.** Never commit `.env`, captured data, screenshots of real attacks, private IP addresses or host names. Use the documentation ranges (`192.0.2.0/24`, `198.51.100.0/24`, `203.0.113.0/24`) in examples.
- **Docker Compose only.** Every component is a service in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Read the [Security](SECURITY.md) page** before you change a sensor, the network layout or a Dockerfile.

## Set up

1. Install Docker with the Compose plugin, and `just`.
2. Install the git hooks, once:

   ```bash
   scripts/install-hooks.sh
   ```

   The script installs `pre-commit` if it can, and falls back to a plain git hook. Both run `gitleaks` before each commit and block commits that contain secrets. The fallback installs a pinned `gitleaks` binary in `~/.local/bin`.

3. Create your `.env`, as described in [Getting started](getting-started.md).

## Common commands

All commands are `just` recipes. Run `just` with no arguments to list them.

### Stack

| Recipe | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `just up` | Run the port guard, build the images and start the stack. Waits until everything is healthy. |
| `just up-test` | Start the stack with dashboard login **off**, through `docker-compose.ci.yml`. For tests and local trials only: the end-to-end recipes below need it. Never on a machine that other people can reach. |
| `just down` | Stop the stack. Data volumes are kept. |
| `just logs [service ...]` | Follow the logs. For example, `just logs ingest api`. |
| `just ps` | Show the state of the services |
| `just ports` | Run `scripts/check-ports.sh`: refuse a port layout that exposes the wrong thing (see [Deployment](deployment.md#port-guard)) |
| `just config` | Run the port guard, then check that `docker-compose.yml` is valid |
| `just psql` | Open a `psql` shell as the database owner, inside the database container. Maintenance only. |

### Backup and restore

| Recipe | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `just backup` | Dump the database into `./backups` (`BACKUP_DIR`, `BACKUP_KEEP`). See [Deployment](deployment.md#backups). |
| `just restore FILE` | Replace the whole database with a dump. Asks for confirmation. |

### Data and end-to-end checks

| Recipe | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `just demo [args]` | Generate demo data. For example, `just demo --sessions 200 --days 3`. |
| `just demo-live` | Keep sending demo traffic until you press Ctrl+C |
| `just ssh-test` | Log in to the SSH sensor for real from a throwaway container, run two commands (one is a fake download), and wait until the session shows up in the API. The same script runs in CI. |

### Python

| Recipe | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `just lint` | `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` on every Python package, then the web lint |
| `just fmt` | Fix and format the Python code with `ruff` |
| `just typecheck` | `mypy` (strict) on every Python package |
| `just test` | Unit tests of every Python package, then the web unit tests. Integration tests are skipped. |
| `just test-integration` | Integration tests against a real database and Redis. It uses its own throwaway Compose project (`<project>-it`) and removes its volumes afterwards, so your real data is never touched. |
| `just check` | Everything: `lint`, `typecheck`, `test` and `web-build` |

`just test-integration` runs `docker-compose.it.yml` on top of `docker-compose.yml`. The overlay keeps `redis` on the `backend` network only, and drops its per-sensor networks. So the throwaway project fits in Docker's default address pools, next to the live stack, which holds its own networks.

### Web

| Recipe | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `just web-install` | Install the web dependencies from the lock file |
| `just web-lint` | `eslint`, `prettier` check and the TypeScript type check |
| `just web-test` | Unit tests (`vitest`) |
| `just web-build` | Production build into `web/dist` |
| `just web-dev` | Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:5173` with mock data (Ctrl+C to stop) |
| `just screenshots` | Playwright screenshots on mock data, at 1440 px and 390 px, dark and light, into `web/screenshots` |

## Tooling runs in containers

The host needs only Docker and `just`. No Python, Node.js or database is installed on it.

- **Python.** `lint`, `typecheck` and `test` run in a pinned `uv` image, once per package, as your user. The virtual environments live inside the container, and the `uv` download cache lives in a Docker volume (`suckerpot-uv-cache`). Nothing is written to the repository.
- **Web.** The web recipes run in a pinned Node image, with `pnpm` enabled through Corepack. A Docker volume (`suckerpot-web-cache`) holds the Corepack and `pnpm` caches. The lock file is always installed with `--frozen-lockfile`.
- **Screenshots.** They run in the pinned Playwright image, against a build with mock data. Mock data uses documentation addresses only, so the screenshots are safe to publish.
- **Images.** Every base image is pinned to a version, so a build today and a build next month use the same tools.

All twelve sensors are in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Python packages

Each package has its own `pyproject.toml` and a committed `uv.lock`. The code targets Python 3.13. The tools are `uv`, `ruff` (line length 100), `mypy` (strict) and `pytest`.

| Directory | Distribution name | Import name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sensors/common` | `suckerpot-common` | `suckerpot_common` | Event model, stream helpers, Redis publisher |
| `scripts/demo` | `suckerpot-demo` | `demo` | Demo data generator |
| `db` | `suckerpot-db` | `suckerpot_db` | Models and migrations |
| `ingest` | `suckerpot-ingest` | `ingest` | Redis consumer, validation and database writes |
| `api` | `suckerpot-api` | `api` | REST API and live feed |
| `sensors/ssh` | `suckerpot-sensor-ssh` | `ssh_sensor` | SSH sensor |
| `sensors/telnet` | `suckerpot-sensor-telnet` | `telnet_sensor` | Telnet sensor |
| `sensors/adb` | `suckerpot-sensor-adb` | `adb_sensor` | ADB sensor |
| `sensors/web` | `suckerpot-sensor-web` | `web_sensor` | Web sensor |
| `sensors/docker` | `suckerpot-sensor-docker` | `docker_sensor` | Docker Engine API sensor |
| `sensors/redis` | `suckerpot-sensor-redis` | `redis_sensor` | Redis sensor |
| `sensors/mysql` | `suckerpot-sensor-mysql` | `mysql_sensor` | MySQL sensor |
| `sensors/mssql` | `suckerpot-sensor-mssql` | `mssql_sensor` | MSSQL sensor |
| `sensors/rdp` | `suckerpot-sensor-rdp` | `rdp_sensor` | RDP sensor |
| `sensors/smb` | `suckerpot-sensor-smb` | `smb_sensor` | SMB sensor |
| `sensors/sip` | `suckerpot-sensor-sip` | `sip_sensor` | SIP sensor |
| `sensors/synology` | `suckerpot-sensor-synology` | `synology_sensor` | Synology DSM sensor |

The recipes `just lint`, `just typecheck` and `just test` run over every directory in the `packages` variable of the `justfile`: all twelve sensors, `sensors/common`, `scripts/demo`, `db`, `ingest` and `api`. The CI `python` job uses the same list. Each package also has its own `pyproject.toml`, so you can run `uv sync`, `uv run ruff check`, `uv run mypy .` and `uv run python -m pytest` from its directory.

Every sensor has a `tests/test_static.py`. It reads the sensor's own code and fails on forbidden calls (`subprocess`, `eval`, `exec` and the like), on outbound sockets and on file writes outside the data folder. Several sensors also ship a `tests/blackbox.sh` script that runs real clients (such as `nmap`) against the sensor. Read the header of the script for the tools it needs.

Packages depend on each other by path. For example, `ingest` depends on `suckerpot-common` and `suckerpot-db`.

## Docker images

Every service image is built from a multi-stage Dockerfile:

- A pinned Python base image (`python:3.13.x-slim-bookworm`).
- The `uv` binary copied from a pinned `uv` image.
- A final stage with a non-root user, no build tools and `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`.
- A health check.

Build contexts are the repository root for the Python services, so that path dependencies resolve.

## Commits and branches

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat(ingest): ...`, `fix(api): ...`, `docs: ...`, `chore: ...`.
- Keep commits small and focused.
- Work on a branch per milestone (`feat/m1`, and so on). Merge it into `main` when the milestone is done.

## Continuous integration

The GitHub Actions workflows run on every push and pull request to `main`:

| Workflow and job | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| `ci.yml`, `gitleaks` | Scans the full git history with `gitleaks` |
| `ci.yml`, `python` | Lint, type check and unit tests of each Python package |
| `ci.yml`, `web` | Install, lint, type check, unit tests and production build of the web app |
| `ci.yml`, `web-screenshots` | Playwright screenshots on mock data, uploaded as an artifact for 7 days |
| `ci.yml`, `python-integration` | Integration tests against a real database and Redis |
| `ci.yml`, `compose` | Runs the port guard, builds the stack, checks the API health and the SSH sensor health, runs a real SSH login (`scripts/ssh-test.sh`), generates demo data, and waits until the API shows the stored sessions |
| `docs.yml` | Builds this documentation site with warnings treated as errors |
| `pages.yml` | Publishes the project page and the offline mock-data dashboard on pushes to `main` |

Dependabot keeps the pinned actions, base images and dependencies up to date.

The `compose` job is the only place where the placeholder secrets are allowed. It sets `SUCKERPOT_ALLOW_DEFAULT_SECRETS=1` in a throwaway `.env`, and moves the SSH sensor to another host port because the runner's own `sshd` uses port 22. Never copy that setting to a real host.

Read the Docs builds the site from `.readthedocs.yaml`, using the same pinned requirements.

## Building these docs locally

The docs use Sphinx with MyST Markdown. The versions are pinned in `docs/requirements.txt`. Build them in a container, so nothing is installed on the host:

```bash
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -e HOME=/tmp \
  -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work python:3.13-slim \
  sh -c 'pip install --quiet --user -r docs/requirements.txt && python -m sphinx -W --keep-going -b html docs /tmp/docs-html'
```

The build must finish with no warnings. The output goes to `/tmp` inside the container, so the repository stays clean.

## Before you commit

1. Run `just lint`, `just typecheck` and `just test`.
2. Read `git diff --staged`. Look for secrets, private addresses, host names and captured data.
3. Commit with a Conventional Commit message.
