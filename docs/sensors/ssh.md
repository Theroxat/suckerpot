# SSH sensor

```{admonition} Status
:class: note

Built in M2 and wired into Compose as `sensor-ssh`. Reviewed by the security review process described in [Security](../SECURITY.md).

## What it emulates

An OpenSSH 9.6p1 server on Ubuntu, with a shell that is pure emulation. It listens on container port 2222. Compose maps the host port (`SSH_HOST_PORT`, default 22) to it, so no capability is needed.

- **Handshake.** The key exchange, cipher, MAC, compression and host key algorithm lists are those of OpenSSH 9.6 on Ubuntu 24.04, in the same order.
- **Logins.** Password and keyboard-interactive logins succeed for the pairs in `SSH_ACCEPT_CREDENTIALS`, or for any non-empty password with probability `SSH_ACCEPT_RANDOM_PROB`. Public keys are recorded (type and SHA256 fingerprint) and rejected. After `SSH_MAX_AUTH_ATTEMPTS` failures the connection ends with OpenSSH's "Too many authentication failures".
- **Shell.** Interactive PTY sessions, piped input and `exec` requests. An in-memory, copy-on-write fake file system built from a base image. Errors go to the stderr channel when there is no PTY.
- **Downloads.** `wget`, `curl`, `tftp`, `ftpget` and `scp host:path` only emit `download_attempt` events and leave a few-byte stub file. Nothing is fetched. `scp -t` uploads are hashed and discarded, and recorded in a `command` event.
- **Port forwarding** requests are refused and recorded as `scan` events. The `sftp` subsystem is accepted and closed with exit status 127, like an sshd with a broken `sftp-server`.

## What it records

All events use the shared [Event schema](../event-schema.md). `dst_port` is the public port (`SSH_PUBLIC_PORT`).

| Event `type` | `data` keys |
| --- | --- |
| `connect` | `client_version`, `banner` |
| `login_attempt` | `username`, `password` (null for a public key), `success`, `method`. A public key adds `key_type` and `key_fingerprint`. |
| `command` | `input`, `output` (8 KiB cap), `output_preview` (1 KiB), `cwd`, `user`, `prompt`, `status`. `output_omitted` when the byte budget dropped `output`. A collapsed repeat has `repeat_count`, `first_ts` and `last_ts` and no `output`. |
| `download_attempt` | `url`, `tool`, `command`, `cwd`, `user` |
| `scan` | `kind` = `tcp_forward_attempt` (`host`, `port`), `events_suppressed` (`count`), or `connection_summary` (`count`, `rejected`, `first_seen`, `last_seen`, `interval_s`) |
| `disconnect` | `duration_s`, `reason`, `login_attempts`, `commands`, `downloads`, `events_suppressed`, `replay`, `replay_truncated`, `replay_omitted` |

### Terminal recording

The `disconnect` event carries `data.replay`: a list of frames `[delta_seconds, "o" | "i", text]`. `o` is output sent to the client (including the echo). `i` is input typed by the client. `delta_seconds` is relative to the previous frame. The newest frames that fit in 12 KiB of compact JSON are kept. If older frames were dropped, `data.replay_truncated` is `true`. The whole event stays below 16 KiB.

`command` events also carry `input`, `output` and `prompt` with accurate timestamps, so a command-level replay works even when the raw recording was truncated.

```{warning}
The recording holds attacker-controlled bytes, including terminal escape sequences. The dashboard must render it with the safety contract in [Security](../SECURITY.md#terminal-replay-safety-contract). The replay player itself is planned for M5.
```

## Limits and abuse resistance

The SSH sensor went through four review passes and passed the fourth. Most of what follows came out of those reviews. The idea throughout: an attacker can send as much as the network allows, so every resource the sensor spends on a connection has a budget, and the budget is enforced **before** the work is done.

### Per connection and per shell

| Scope | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Connections | `SSH_MAX_CONNECTIONS` in total (200), `SSH_MAX_PER_IP` per source (5). New connections per source are rate limited (`SSH_CONN_RATE_PER_IP`, burst `SSH_CONN_BURST_PER_IP`) and excess ones are closed at once. |
| Timeouts | Login `SSH_LOGIN_TIMEOUT` (30 s), idle `SSH_IDLE_TIMEOUT` (300 s), whole session `SSH_MAX_SESSION` (1800 s) |
| Per connection | 2 session channels, 20 refused requests, one shared fake file system (1 MiB, 2000 nodes), 5000 commands, auth requests capped at 4 times `SSH_MAX_AUTH_ATTEMPTS` |
| Per shell | 256 variables and 64 KiB, 64 KiB of history, 64 KiB per expanded word |
| Per command line | A CPU budget (`SSH_LINE_BUDGET`, 0.15 s: the line is aborted with `Killed`), 200 simple commands, 64 KiB of output |

Output sizes are computed or capped **before** a result is built, never built and then cut: 256 KiB per command (stdout and stderr share it), 2000 characters per line and 5000 lines when a command splits text, 1 MiB read across all the files of one command, bounded `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `sed`, `tr`, `base64` and `date`, `>>` and `tee` checked against the file system cap first, and nested shells capped while they run. Attacker text never reaches a regular expression with nested quantifiers: `awk` and `sed` programs are parsed by hand, and `grep` patterns become globs.

### Floods

- **Input is flow-controlled.** Each session channel has a small window (`SSH_CHANNEL_WINDOW_KB`, 32 KiB). The accounting counts data that is still buffered, so a channel never holds more than about twice the window of unread input. A session whose unread input exceeds four windows is closed (`input flood`).
- **Inbound data is metered before it is decrypted.** Socket data is fed in 4 KiB slices, one per loop step, within a per-connection budget (`SSH_INBOUND_CONN_KB_PER_SEC`, 32 KiB/s) and a sensor-wide one (`SSH_INBOUND_KB_PER_SEC`, 256 KiB/s) shared fairly between source addresses. While a budget is used up the socket is not read, and TCP pushes back on the client. This bounds tiny-packet floods, where every packet costs a decryption. It also means an `scp` upload can never exceed about 32 KiB/s.
- **Shell CPU is shared fairly.** All command lines together may use `SSH_SHELL_CPU_SHARE` CPU-seconds per second (0.3, burst `SSH_SHELL_CPU_BURST`). When it is used up, commands queue, and the source address that used the least CPU recently goes first, so one address with many channels cannot starve the others. A command that waits more than 10 s fails with `fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable`.
- **Memory has three layers.** A budget over all sessions (`SSH_MEMORY_BUDGET_MB`, 48), of which one source address may hold at most `SSH_MEMORY_SHARE_PER_IP` (25%). Beyond it, new sessions are refused and commands fail with `Cannot allocate memory`. On top of that, a **cgroup memory guard** compares the container's real memory use with its limit once a second. Above `SSH_MEMORY_PRESSURE` (70%) new connections and sessions are refused and the biggest connections stop being read. Above `SSH_MEMORY_CRITICAL` (85%) the biggest connections are closed. The guard acts only while sessions and queued events hold at least 10% of the limit, so heap that the allocator merely kept after a burst does not trigger it.
- **A watchdog** thread exits the process (status 70) if the event loop does not run for 10 s, so Compose restarts the container. Lags over 1 s are logged.

### Event budgets

Events are limited by count and, since the last review, by **bytes**:

- Counts: `connect` per source address, `scan` and `login_attempt` per session, `command` and `download_attempt` per session in a separate quota, and a sensor-wide cap (`SSH_GLOBAL_EVENTS_PER_SEC`). Ten percent of that cap is reserved for the `disconnect` events of sessions that logged in or ran a command, so those are lost last.
- Bytes: per source address (`SSH_IP_EVENT_BYTES_PER_SEC`, 20 KB/s, burst 1 MB) and sensor-wide (`SSH_GLOBAL_EVENT_BYTES_PER_SEC`, 200 KB/s, burst 2 MB). An event that does not fit is first **degraded**: a `command` keeps its `input` and the 1 KiB `output_preview` and gets `output_omitted`; a `disconnect` loses its recording and gets `replay_omitted`. If even the degraded event does not fit, it is **dropped** and counted. The in-process event queue is capped at 8 MiB.
- A last backstop sits in the shared publisher for all sensors: `EVENTS_MAX_BYTES_PER_SEC` (200 kB/s) and `EVENTS_MAX_BYTES_BURST` (2 MB).
- **Repeats are collapsed.** Consecutive identical command lines in a connection are reported once as a normal `command` event, and the repeats as a single `command` event with `repeat_count`, `first_ts` and `last_ts`. It is sent when another line comes, at the end of the session, or every 1000 repeats.
- Suppressed events are counted. The `disconnect` event carries `events_suppressed`, and for sessions that logged in or ran a command a `scan` event with `kind = events_suppressed` is emitted.
- Connections that never send an authentication request (port scans, banner grabs) and connections refused by a limit get no `connect` or `disconnect`. They are counted per source address and reported every `SSH_SUMMARY_INTERVAL` seconds as one `scan` event with `kind = connection_summary`.

### Container

Non-root (UID 10001), read-only root file system with a `tmpfs` at `/tmp`, all capabilities dropped, 256 MB memory with no swap, 0.5 CPU, 128 processes. A volume holds the host keys.

## Configuration

Compose sets the Redis variables. The rest can be overridden in `.env` where noted. The full table of every variable is in [Configuration](../configuration.md#ssh-sensor).

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SSH_HOST_PORT` | `22` | Host port (Compose only) |
| `SSH_BANNER` | `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1 Ubuntu-3ubuntu13.14` | Version string |
| `SSH_HOSTNAME` | `srv-web01` | Fake host name |
| `SSH_ACCEPT_CREDENTIALS` | weak set | Comma list of `user:password` |
| `SSH_ACCEPT_RANDOM_PROB` | `0.0` | Chance of accepting any non-empty password |
| `SSH_MAX_AUTH_ATTEMPTS` | `6` | Attempts per connection |
| `SSH_MAX_CONNECTIONS`, `SSH_MAX_PER_IP` | `200`, `5` | Connection caps |

## Fingerprint notes

What an attacker can tell apart from a real OpenSSH:

- The post-quantum key exchange `sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com` is missing (asyncssh does not support it).
- The list of authentication methods is `publickey,keyboard-interactive,password`. Ubuntu's default is `publickey,password`.
- The RSA host key is not offered as `ssh-rsa`, as in a real 9.6 server. Tools such as `nmap`'s `ssh-hostkey` script then list only the ECDSA and ED25519 keys.

The fake machine identity (private address, MAC, uptime, last-login address, DNS answers) comes from a random secret created once, next to the host keys. It is **not** derived from the public host key, so nobody can predict the fake `ip a` output from the key fingerprint and recognise the sensor. Keep the data volume persistent: a warning is logged whenever keys are generated.

Host keys and the secret are generated on first start, mode 0600. They are never committed.

## Test it

```bash
just ssh-test
```

The recipe logs in for real from a throwaway container, runs two commands (one is a fake download) and waits until the session shows up in the API. See [Development](../development.md).
