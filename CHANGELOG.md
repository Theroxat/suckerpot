## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Bootstrap (M0) and foundations (M1): MIT licence, project rules, roadmap, architecture and security docs, a gitleaks pre-commit hook and CI; the shared event schema, a Redis Streams pipeline, a TimescaleDB schema with Alembic migrations, an ingest consumer and an API with a live WebSocket feed.
- Demo data generator (`just demo`): synthetic sessions across all four sensors with documentation IP ranges only, plus a live mode.
- SSH sensor: OpenSSH 9.6 fingerprint, configurable weak logins, an emulated shell on a fake filesystem, download recording without fetching, and timed session recording for replay.
- Telnet sensor: BusyBox telnetd look-alike with Mirai-style flows.
- Web sensor: byte-identical Apache 2.4.58 with PHP 8.3, fake WordPress and phpMyAdmin pages, and PHP2Shell (upload-progress) detection.
- RDP sensor: Windows Server look-alike with NLA and username capture.
- Enrichment: GeoIP and ASN from DB-IP Lite (no key) or MaxMind GeoLite2, optional AbuseIPDB and GreyNoise Community reputation with a 24 h cache and enforced daily quotas.
- Tagging: a declarative YAML rules engine without regular expressions (`recon`, `mirai`, `crypto-miner`, `malware-drop`, `php2shell`).
- Dashboard: Live (3D globe and event feed), Overview (KPIs and auto-written insights), Attacks, Session detail with terminal replay, Attackers, Trends, Malware (defanged URLs) and Settings, in dark and light on desktop and mobile; a design system; a screenshot mode (`?mask=1`); Playwright screenshots.
- Dashboard login: a single admin account with an argon2 password hash, CSRF protection and a rate-limited login.
- Retention and storage: raw events kept 90 days, aggregates forever, compression, a disk guard, and `just backup` / `just restore`.
- Hardened Docker Compose stack with a host firewall template in `scripts/host/`.
- Documentation site (Sphinx, Read the Docs) and a project page.
- Repository meta: README, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue and pull request templates, Dependabot and release-note configuration.

### Security

- No attacker input is ever executed: every sensor passed several rounds of adversarial security review (the web sensor's final review is pending).
- Isolation: four networks with an internal backend, one Redis ACL user per sensor limited to `XADD` on its own stream, least-privilege database roles, no outbound route for the API, non-root read-only containers with all capabilities dropped.
- The first review of the M1 stack found unbounded stream growth, egress, poison-message and default-credential issues; all were fixed and the second pass passed.
